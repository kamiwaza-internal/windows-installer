# Canonical Installer Flow and Restart Policy

## ✅ How the Installer SHOULD Run (Authoritative Flow)
- **WSL setup**: Ensure WSL is installed and functional. Repair if needed. Do not proceed until WSL is usable.
- **GPU detection and setup**:
  - Detect NVIDIA, Intel Arc, or Intel Integrated via Windows WMI.
  - Copy and run the matching WSL setup script (`setup_nvidia_gpu.sh`, `setup_intel_arc_gpu.sh`, `setup_intel_integrated_gpu.sh`).
  - All GPU scripts run non-interactively (`DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive`); no prompts.
- **Kamiwaza package installation**:
  - Download the `.deb` into WSL (`/tmp/<file>.deb`).
  - Install with `sudo apt install -y <deb>`, streaming logs to `/tmp/kamiwaza_install.log` and `/var/log/apt/term.log`.
- **Register autostart (RunOnce)**:
  - Create a `RunOnce` entry `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce` → `KamiwazaGPUAutostart` pointing to `kamiwaza_autostart.bat`.
  - On reboot this runs: `wsl -d kamiwaza -- kamiwaza start`.
- **Automatic full device restart**:
  - Optional interactive pause if TTY: “Press Enter to proceed with FULL DEVICE restart…”.
  - 10-second visible countdown.
  - Execute `shutdown /r /t 0` to restart the entire Windows device (not just WSL).

## 🔁 After Reboot
- `RunOnce` triggers `kamiwaza_autostart.bat`.
- Starts platform with: `wsl -d kamiwaza -- kamiwaza start`.
- If anything fails, window remains open (batch files end with `pause >nul`) so logs are visible.

## 🧾 Logging & Visibility
- Python installer logs to multiple locations:
  - `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Kamiwaza\logs\kamiwaza_installer.log` (primary Windows log)
  - `%TEMP%\kamiwaza_installer_temp.log` (fallback)
  - `kamiwaza_installer_simple.log` (CWD fallback)
- WSL logs you can copy/view:
  - `/var/log/apt/term.log`, `/var/log/apt/history.log`, `/var/log/dpkg.log`
- All critical batch files end with `pause >nul` to keep the window open for debugging.

## [WARNING]️ Important Distinctions
- `wsl --shutdown` only stops WSL instances (Linux VMs). It is NOT a Windows restart.
- `shutdown /r /t 0` performs a FULL Windows device restart and is required after GPU + package setup.

## ✅ Do This
- **Use non-interactive installs** inside WSL (`DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive`).
- **Detect GPU via WMI** in Python and prefer independent detection if it disagrees with PowerShell.
- **Copy scripts into WSL** via reliable methods (tee, unique temp names, `dos2unix`, `chmod +x`).
- **Create RunOnce** to autostart Kamiwaza after restart.
- **Show a clear countdown/pause** before the automatic device restart.
- **Keep windows open** in batch files using `pause >nul` for user visibility.

## 🚫 Do NOT Do This
- **Do NOT embed Bash or Unix syntax inside PowerShell/BAT** contexts. Keep Bash in `.sh` files executed via WSL; keep PowerShell/BAT clean.
- **Do NOT use non-DOS/Windows-unsafe characters** (e.g., emojis, high Unicode) in WiX, BAT, or PowerShell that may cause codepage/linker issues.
- **Do NOT trigger restarts before package installation** or without a visible notice. The restart happens only after GPU setup AND package install.
- **Do NOT add extra manual touchpoints** requiring users to run ad-hoc CMD steps; the flow must be automated end-to-end with clear output.
- **Do NOT rely solely on WSL shutdown** for driver activation; a full Windows restart is required.

# Current Issue Context - Kamiwaza Installer Script Visibility

## 🎯 Current Issue Summary
**Problem**: Batch scripts launched by the MSI installer were closing immediately, preventing users from seeing error messages or execution results.

**Impact**: Users couldn't debug installation issues because script windows closed too quickly.

## [SUCCESS] What We Fixed

### Batch File Modifications
We added `pause >nul` to the end of all critical batch files:

1. **`create_runonce.bat`** [SUCCESS] Fixed
   - Added `pause >nul` to keep window open
   - Fixed path concatenation issue with backslash handling

2. **`run_kamiwaza.bat`** [SUCCESS] Fixed
   - Added `pause >nul` to keep window open
   - Now shows execution results before closing

3. **`start_platform.bat`** [SUCCESS] Fixed
   - Added `pause >nul` to keep window open
   - Allows debugging of platform startup issues

4. **`detect_gpu_cmd.bat`** [SUCCESS] Fixed

# Kamiwaza Installer Project - Specific Rules

## 🎯 Project Context
This is a **Windows MSI installer** for Kamiwaza, a WSL-based platform with GPU acceleration support. The installer uses WiX, CustomActions, and batch file integration.

## 🚨 Project-Specific Critical Rules

### WiX/MSI Compilation
- **NEVER ignore** WiX compiler errors - they WILL cause installation failures
- **ALWAYS test** WiX compilation after ANY changes to `installer.wxs`
- **NEVER assume** CustomActions work just because they look correct
- **ALWAYS verify** file paths and registry entries are correct

### CustomAction Syntax Rules
- **NEVER mix** `FileKey` and `Directory` attributes in CustomActions
- **ALWAYS use** `FileKey` for file-based CustomActions
- **NEVER use** `Directory` when `FileKey` is specified
- **ALWAYS test** CustomAction execution after changes

### Batch File Integration
- **ALWAYS add** `pause >nul` to batch files for debugging visibility
- **NEVER use** `exit /b` without user interaction first
- **ALWAYS test** batch files manually before including in MSI
- **NEVER assume** paths are correct without verification

## 🔧 Common Issues & Solutions

### WiX Compilation Errors

#### CNDL0022: CustomAction/@Directory attribute conflict
**Problem**: Mixing `FileKey` and `Directory` attributes
**Solution**: Remove `Directory` attribute when using `FileKey`

#### CNDL0005: Unexpected RegistryValue element
**Problem**: RegistryValue in wrong location or format
**Solution**: Use CustomActions for registry manipulation

#### CNDL1077: Property reference warnings
**Problem**: Property values that look like references
**Solution**: Use CustomActions with batch files for complex operations

### Path Handling Issues

#### Missing Backslashes in Paths
**Problem**: `C:\path\file` vs `C:\pathfile`
**Solution**: Always ensure proper path concatenation in batch files

#### File Not Found Errors
**Problem**: Files not deployed or wrong paths
**Solution**: Verify file inclusion in MSI and test paths manually

### CustomAction Execution Failures

#### Return Code 1 (Failure)
**Problem**: CustomAction failed to execute
**Solution**: Test batch file manually, check file paths, verify parameters

#### Missing Files
**Problem**: CustomAction can't find required files
**Solution**: Verify file deployment, check working directory, test manually

## 🧪 Project Testing Requirements

### Before Any "Fix" Declaration
1. **WiX Compilation Test**
   ```bash
   ./build.bat
   # Verify: "WiX compilation completed" message
   ```
